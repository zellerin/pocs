#+TITLE: Random code

This directory contains some low-maturity code that I want to have
access to, but does not deserve own repository (maybe yet).

Namely:
- Pic assembler code for 16f630 to [[lcd.asm][drive LCD]] and some [[lcdn.asm][demo]] around it,
- Some fontification files, often for Windows
- Intentionally insecure Hunchentoot web application
